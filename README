Copy of the NVME kernel module from 3.16.1, to be modified for the
Donard project. Includes code to DMA directly between NVMe devices and
NVIDIA GPUs.

There are two modules here: nvme_donard which is just the standard
nvme module plus some additional ioctl's for initiating transfers and
the donard_nv_pinbuf which provides a char device and some ioctls for
creating pinned buffers on a GPU.

If you get warnings that symbols do not exist you must regenerate the
nvidia symbols with:

sudo make nvidia-syms
